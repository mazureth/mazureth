              Jesse Mazur, owner, producer, and engineer at Mazureth Studios, has been producing music since
              2003 and playing for much longer. He's worked with artists ranging from ambient electronic to
              technical death metal and everything inbetween. He's toured the country in several
              bands and has been signed to both Altantic and Dream Works records. Whether you need an audio
              engineering, a producer, help with arragement, or writing, Jesse is more than capable.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Jesse's also a multi-instumentalist and is happy to do session work on your album as well.
              While his primary instrument is guitar, he is also a skilled drummer and can play most stringed
              instruments, most brass instruments, and can navigate is way around a piano pretty well. He also has
              several years of singing and vocal lessons under his belt. It's very common for Jesse to appear
              on the albums created at Mazureth Studios.

            <h3>Alpenglow</h3>
            <p>
              Hailing from Seattle, Aplenglow is a bluegrass trio that seeks to re-imagine the genre by blending a classic, 
              acoustic foundation with rhythmic and melodic flavors normally seen in rock, pop, and dance music. Their songs take
              the listener on a musical journey that has roots in Americana with story-like lyrical content. Long instrumental
              interludes throughout add a progressive element that musicians are drawn too but keep the average listener engaged.
              The three piece includes Jacob Lamonaco on guitar, Boris Sagal on mandolin, and Keith Wyss on upright bass.
